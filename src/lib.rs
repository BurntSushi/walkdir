/*!
Crate `walkdir` provides an efficient and cross platform implementation
of recursive directory traversal. Several options are exposed to control
iteration, such as whether to follow symbolic links (default off), limit the
maximum number of simultaneous open file descriptors and the ability to
efficiently skip descending into directories.

To use this crate, add `walkdir` as a dependency to your project's
`Cargo.toml`:

```ignore
[dependencies]
walkdir = "1"
```

# From the top

The `WalkDir` type builds iterators. The `WalkDirIterator` trait provides
methods for directory iterator adapters, such as efficiently pruning entries
during traversal. The `DirEntry` type describes values yielded by the iterator.
Finally, the `Error` type is a small wrapper around `std::io::Error` with
additional information, such as if a loop was detected while following symbolic
links (not enabled by default).

# Example

The following code recursively iterates over the directory given and prints
the path for each entry:

```rust,no_run
use walkdir::WalkDir;

for entry in WalkDir::new("foo") {
    let entry = entry.unwrap();
    println!("{}", entry.path().display());
}
```

Or, if you'd like to iterate over all entries and ignore any errors that may
arise, use `filter_map`. (e.g., This code below will silently skip directories
that the owner of the running process does not have permission to access.)

```rust,no_run
use walkdir::WalkDir;

for entry in WalkDir::new("foo").into_iter().filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {
    println!("{}", entry.path().display());
}
```

# Example: follow symbolic links

The same code as above, except `follow_links` is enabled:

```rust,no_run
use walkdir::WalkDir;

for entry in WalkDir::new("foo").follow_links(true) {
    let entry = entry.unwrap();
    println!("{}", entry.path().display());
}
```

# Example: skip hidden files and directories efficiently on unix

This uses the `filter_entry` iterator adapter to avoid yielding hidden files
and directories efficiently:

```rust,no_run
use walkdir::{DirEntry, WalkDir, WalkDirIterator};

fn is_hidden(entry: &DirEntry) -> bool {
    entry.file_name()
         .to_str()
         .map(|s| s.starts_with("."))
         .unwrap_or(false)
}

let walker = WalkDir::new("foo").into_iter();
for entry in walker.filter_entry(|e| !is_hidden(e)) {
    let entry = entry.unwrap();
    println!("{}", entry.path().display());
}
```

/// A builder to create an iterator for recursively walking a directory.
///
/// Results are returned in depth first fashion, with directories yielded
/// before their contents. The order is unspecified. Directory entries `.`
/// and `..` are always omitted.
///
/// If an error occurs at any point during iteration, then it is returned in
/// place of its corresponding directory entry and iteration continues as
/// normal. If an error occurs while opening a directory for reading, it
/// is skipped. Iteration may be stopped at any time. When the iterator is
/// destroyed, all resources associated with it are freed.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This type implements `IntoIterator` so that it may be used as the subject
/// of a `for` loop. You may need to call `into_iter` explicitly if you want
/// to use iterator adapters such as `filter_entry`.
///
/// Idiomatic use of this type should use method chaining to set desired
/// options. For example, this only shows entries with a depth of `1`, `2`
/// or `3` (relative to `foo`):
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use walkdir::WalkDir;
///
/// for entry in WalkDir::new("foo").min_depth(1).max_depth(3) {
///     let entry = entry.unwrap();
///     println!("{}", entry.path().display());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that the iterator by default includes the top-most directory. Since
/// this is the only directory yielded with depth `0`, it is easy to ignore it
/// with the `min_depth` setting:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use walkdir::WalkDir;
///
/// for entry in WalkDir::new("foo").min_depth(1) {
///     let entry = entry.unwrap();
///     println!("{}", entry.path().display());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will only return descendents of the `foo` directory and not `foo`
/// itself.
///
/// # Loops
///
/// This iterator (like most/all recursive directory iterators) assumes that
/// no loops can be made with *hard* links on your file system. In particular,
/// this would require creating a hard link to a directory such that it creates
/// a loop. On most platforms, this operation is illegal.
///
/// Note that when following symbolic/soft links, loops are detected and an
/// error is reported.
